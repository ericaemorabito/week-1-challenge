# <Week-1-Challenge>

## Description

This week's challenge was to improve the codebase for long-term sustainabilitiy. I refactored the starter code to be more semantic, easy to read, and concise.This refactoring will make the source code easier to maintain and update as the company Horiseon evolves. It also make their website accessible to all. I learned more about CSS selectors and HTML structure.
