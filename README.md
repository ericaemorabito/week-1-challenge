# <Week-1-Challenge>

## Description

This week's challenge was to improve the source code for long-term sustainabilitiy. I refactored the starter code to be more semantic, easy to read, and concise. This refactoring makes the code easier to maintain and update as the company, Horiseon, evolves. It also makes their website accessible. During this challenge, I learned more about CSS selectors and HTML structure.

## Installation

Open index.html file.
Right click.
Click "Open in Chosen Browser."

## Usage

When you navigate to the Horiseon homepage, you can read click on one of the three links at the top right to navigate and read about the topics.
